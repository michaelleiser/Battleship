 * This class is responsible to ESTABLISH a network connection to the server,
 * to CLOSE the connection correctly when it is no more needed,
 * to RECONNECT automatically if there was a network problem
 * and to KEEP the connection ALIVE to be sure the server is still available.
 * 
 * It also provides an interface to the server to receive messages like to
 * STOP the game when the other player has given up or if there is a
 * network problem, to WAIT for a certain time.
